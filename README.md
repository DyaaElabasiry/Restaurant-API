* **ASP.NET Core:** For building the web API.
* **Entity Framework Core:** For data access and object-relational mapping (ORM).
* **SQL Server:** The database provider used in this project.
* **MediatR:** To implement the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern.
* **AutoMapper:** For object-to-object mapping between entities and DTOs.
* **Swashbuckle:** For generating Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.
* **xUnit, Moq, FluentAssertions:** For unit and integration testing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* .NET 9 SDK
* SQL Server

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    git clone [https://github.com/DyaaElabasiry/Restaurant-API.git](https://github.com/DyaaElabasiry/Restaurant-API.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the API project:**
    ```bash
    cd api/Restaurants.Api
    ```
3.  **Update the database connection string:**

    Open `appsettings.json` and modify the `DefaultConnection` string to point to your SQL Server instance.

    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```
5.  **Run the application:**

The API will be running at `http://localhost:5177`. You can access the Swagger UI for API documentation and testing at `http://localhost:5177/swagger`.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project follows the principles of Clean Architecture, separating concerns into distinct layers:

* **`Restaurants.Domain`:** Contains the core business logic, entities, and interfaces. This layer has no dependencies on other layers.
* **`Restaurants.Application`:** Contains the application logic, including services, DTOs, commands, and queries.
* **`Restaurants.Infrastructure`:** Implements the interfaces defined in the `Domain` and `Application` layers. This includes database access, repository implementations, and other infrastructure-related concerns.
* **`Restaurants.Api`:** The presentation layer, which exposes the API endpoints to the outside world.
* **`Restaurants.ApiTests` & `Restaurants.ApplicationTests`:** Contain unit and integration tests for the API and application layers, respectively.
